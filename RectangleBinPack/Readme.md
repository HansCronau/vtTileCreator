Rectangle Bin Pack
==================

This folder contains an implementation of the bin packing algorithm as originally presented by
Jim Scott at http://www.blackpawn.com/texts/lightmaps/.

The implementation was created by Jukka Jylänki for his survey
"A Thousand Ways to Pack the Bin - A Practical Approach to Two-Dimensional Rectangle Bin Packing"

Jukka refers to this algorithm as the "old" version of the Guillotine method, which he refined while writing.
The "old" version was preferred here for reasons of simplicity.
Slight modifications were made to make it compile.

Jukka Jylänki released his code to the public domain.
